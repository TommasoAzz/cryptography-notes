Functions, in Practice}

\begin{theorem}[Davies-Meyer construction]
If F is modelled as an ideal cipher, then the Davies-Meyer construction induces a collision-resistant hash function in a concrete sense: each attacker of complexity q cannot find collisions with probability greater than $\frac{q^2}{2^{\mathbb{\ell}}}$
